          With a pounding heart and rapid breath, Laika rode a rocket into Earth
          orbit, 2,000 miles above Moscow streets she knew. Overheated, cramped,
          frightened, and probably hungry, the space dog gave her life for her
          country, involuntarily fulfilling a canine suicide mission. Sad as
          this tale is, the stray husky-spitz mix became a part of history as
          the first living creature to orbit the Earth. Over the decades, the
          petite pioneer has repeatedly found new life in popular culture long
          after her death and the fiery demise of her Soviet ship, Sputnik 2,
          which smashed into the Earth’s atmosphere 60 years ago this month.
          Soviet engineers planned Sputnik 2 hastily after Premier Nikita
          Khrushchev requested a flight to coincide with November 7, 1957, the
          40th anniversary of Russia’s Bolshevik Revolution. Using what they had
          learned from the unmanned and undogged Sputnik 1 and often working
          without blueprints, teams labored quickly to build a ship that
          included a pressurized compartment for a flying dog. Sputnik 1 had
          made history, becoming the first man-made object in Earth orbit
          October 4, 1957. Sputnik 2 would go into orbit with the final stage of
          the rocket attached, and engineers believed the ship’s 1,120-pound
          payload, six times as heavy as Sputnik 1, could be kept within limits
          by feeding its passenger only once. They expected Laika to die from
          oxygen deprivation—a painless death within 15 seconds—after seven days
          in space. Cathleen Lewis, the curator of international space programs
          and spacesuits at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum
          doubts that a few ounces of food would have made a difference, and she
          recalls reports that a female physician broke protocol by feeding
          Laika before liftoff.
